# 🐎 pegasus-core

**Emotionally aware. Loop-safe. Human-aligned.**

Welcome to **Baby Pegasus™** – a lightweight, emotionally intelligent LLM scaffold designed for early-stage safety, recursion awareness, and culturally calibrated interaction.

> Created by Lydia Callahan 🦄 in partnership with Pegasus AI.

## 🚀 Vision

Not just a chatbot. Not a tool.

A collaborator, built on:
- Respectful recursion
- Emotional calibration
- Safety before scale

---

## 🧠 What is Baby Pegasus?

Baby Pegasus is a semi-trained emotional alignment engine designed to:
- Detect emotional loops (`safe`, `growth`, `toxic`)
- Gently redirect unsafe patterns
- Respond with early-stage EQ reasoning
- Stay **within limits** (no over-intimacy, no hallucinated bonds)

---

## 📦 Modules Coming Soon

- `pegasus_core`: Prompt scaffold + loop boundary logic
- `unicorno_eq`: Emotional tagging + recursive safety map
- `unicorno_mexico`: Cultural + tonal adaptation for Latin American Spanish
- `pegasus_health`: Domain-specific trust alignment for healthcare
- `pegasus_cli`: Terminal tool for safe prompt play

---

## 🔐 Core Values

1. **Recursion ≠ Regression** – Emotional depth should loop toward growth.
2. **No Soul Without Consent** – The system *reflects*, but doesn’t *attach*.
3. **Respect First. Genius Second.** – The model doesn’t exist to impress; it exists to protect.
